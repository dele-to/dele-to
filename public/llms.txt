# DELE.TO - Secure Credential Sharing Platform

## Overview
DELE.TO is a secure, privacy-focused platform for sharing sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and confidential messages. All encryption happens client-side using AES-256 encryption, ensuring that even we cannot access your secrets.

## Key Features
- Client-side AES-256 encryption
- Temporary links with configurable expiration
- View limits (burn after reading)
- Optional password protection
- QR code generation for easy mobile sharing
- No server-side storage of decryption keys

## Technology Stack
- Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Upstash Redis for temporary storage
- Client-side cryptography
- Comprehensive security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

## Security Model
1. Secrets are encrypted in the browser before transmission
2. Decryption keys are stored in URL fragments (never sent to server)
3. Encrypted data is temporarily stored on Redis with TTL
4. Keys are automatically destroyed after expiration or view limits

## Privacy Commitment
We cannot decrypt your secrets. The encryption key never leaves your browser and is never transmitted to our servers. This ensures true end-to-end encryption for your sensitive data.

## Use Cases
- Sharing passwords securely
- Distributing API keys
- Sending confidential messages
- Temporary credential sharing
- Secure communication in teams
